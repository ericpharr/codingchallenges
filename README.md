# codingchallenges
A repository comprised of Greenlight's coding challenges and everyone's answers.

## Coding Challenge Repository Rules

* This repo is entirely public, anyone can commit to it. Do **NOT** overwrite anyone else's code.
* Every set of challenges will be divided into their own folders based on date, then division.
* Place your own answers in a new folder within the subfolder of the challenge you participated in, labeled with your name.

Example: 
- (Challenge-10-24-2017)
- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|_(Professional)
- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|_(Travis)
- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|_answers.php

* Please remember that this is an open space, the primary objective of this repository is to learn from others and to help others succeed. Any griefing or just in general being a dick will not be tolerated.
* Again, don't overwrite/delete code. Please. Unless it's your own. That's fine.
